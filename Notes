You might manually download the data and toolboxes from the above links 
if FCE_download is not working.

(2) 
If the following error (or the like) occurs, please installl "a C++ 
compiler" first. 
    No supported SDK or compiler was found on this computer. 
    For a list of supported compilers, see

    Error: libsvm-master\matlab\make.m failed (line 13)
    Unable to complete successfully.
    => Please check README for detailed instructions.
Microsoft Windows SDK 7.1 (C++) is generally suggested. You might check 
this link to find the appropriate compiler for your system. 
    https://cn.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/what-you-need-to-build-mex-files.html
Then you could check the C++ compiler by the command "mex -setup c++" 
according to this page:
    https://cn.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/choose-c-or-c-compilers.html
Then run FCE again. It will output the following information if the 
compiler is Microsoft Visual C++ 2012, and you could obtain the 
classification results.
